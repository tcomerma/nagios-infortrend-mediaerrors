check_infortrend_mediaerrors

Objective:
After losing a volume due to undetected media errors in an Infortrend device, we decided to keep
an eye on these errors. We are monitoring these devices using Erinn Looney Triggs excelent plugin
http://gitorious.org/smarmy/check_infortrend but this doesn't detect these errors (because they
only show up in the event log).

So I created this nagios plugin that scans the event log for media errors

Problem 1: The event log is cleared after a reboot, so you lose track of previous error.
Approach: The plugin records on disc the errors, avoiding the problem. But after changing a disc, you must
   manually clear the errors using 
     check_infortrend_mediaerrors.sh -H hostname -x
	 
Problem 2: Some old devices are extremely slow, taking up to 2 minutes to answer.
Approach: To avoid blocking nagios, the plugin can fork the check in background using -s. This gives time to
    the plugin to complete. In the first execution will allways retung OK, and at the second one will find out
	errors from the previous execution


Requirements:
  - smptable
  - Infortrend MIBs

Usage: 
check_infortrend_mediaerrors.sh -H <host> -w <warning> -c <critical> -v -s -x -h
   -v Verbose
   -H <host> Storage device address 
   -w <warning> Raise warning if more than <warning> number of errors per drive.
   -c <critical> Raise warning if more than <critical> number of errors per drive. 
   -s Spawn check process. Usefull for slow devices when used from nagios, to avoid timeouts
   -x Clear stored errors for <host>
